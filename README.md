# Employee-Attendance-Portal

This is a web-based project which takes the raw data from the fingerprint sensor used to record the attendance of the employee and then process the record to determine if the person is late or on time or has taken an early leave. The entire data is provided to admin with appropriate visualization to make it easy to understand and analyze each employee's attendance. Developed using HTML5, CSS3, JS, PHP, and MySQL.
